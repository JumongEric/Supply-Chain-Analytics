**This is a supply chain analytic model.**


The model aims to calculate the maximum profit we can get out of the available quantity, 
and price, considering the available constraints. It is very suitable for supply chain analytics as well as management, 
where different warehouses might have the demand that should be met, taking into consideration the cost of transportation, 
the production capacity of the factory, etc.
